# Artificial Intelligence Course Projects
## CA0: Introduction
Using the Titanic passengers dataset, prediction of whether a passenger will survive or not is done. Also some of the Python data science libraries such as pandas, NumPy, and matplotlib in Jupyter Notebook was used.
## CA1: Search
A problem is solved using the following search algorithms:
* BFS
* DFS & IDS
* A* & Weighrted A*
## CA2: Genetic 
An equation builder is implemented using the genetic algorithms. The problem gives an equation of length n and its answer, genetic methods are used to find what combination of operands and operators satisfy the equation. 
## CA3: Game
In this project the Sim game is implemented using Minimax algorithm. One of the players uses the alpha-beta minimax algorithm, while the other agent plays randomly.
## CA4: Naive Bayes
Classification of news in 5 categories is done using the Naive Bayes algorithm.
## CA5: Machine Learning
Prediction of wheter a person has diabetes or not is implemented using the following classifiers:
* Decision Tree
* K-Nearest Neighbors
* Logistic Regression
* Random Forest
## CA6: Neural Networks
This project has two phases:
* Phase 1: A neural network is implemented and trained to classify images of Arabic handwritten characters.
* Phase 2: Tensorflow library and Keras API are used to classify the CIFAR-10 dataset.
